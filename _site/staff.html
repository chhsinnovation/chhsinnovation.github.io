<h2>A Bit of History from Chaeny Emanavin, Director, Office of Innovation</h2>
<p>The methods we use in the Office of Innovation are constantly being refined. Before I was director, I was fortunate to witness firsthand early efforts to apply modern digital service techniques in the federal government. At Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and later at US Digital Service, I saw different models of bringing smart, dedicated people from industry to build incredible applications for government services. However, in these models skills exchange was secondary. As a long time government employee I know there were smart, dedicated people already serving in government. There is not an ability gap. There is a skills gap. </p>

<p>Skills can be learned.</p>

<p>I wanted to focus on training existing government staff with the skills I observed that make USDS and 18F so successful. However, I never found the opportunity to build this model out. When CA Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Wilkening created the CHHS Office of Innovation, opportunity finally appeared to make this idea into reality. </p>

<p>Another key is to provide staff the opportunity to use these great techniques. These skills are not simply just absorbed, they must practiced. To practice them well means having projects that run unlike anything the government typically does. To have these unique projects means having high level executive buy in providing high level sponsorship, but also not predetermining what the outcome will be while the team learns. This requires a very unique and visionary leadership from Secretary Wilkening and also buy in from the organization to try to do things differently without any guarantee of success. Incrementally, we are changing the culture at CHHS to think about voice of the user and produce products that make government work better.</p>
