<br />
Tl;dr - DSH had an urgent need to reduce the amount of time it took to admit patients into facilities as part of the incompetitent to stand trial process. The existing process was taking up to six months. The team worked with DSH staff across hospitals and the central office to identify redundancies. The initial prototype reduced the expected time to 70 days. The revised prototype further reduced the expected process down to 21 days.</p>

<br />
Tl:dr - External researchers using state health data for their research must request the data. Depending on the departments involved, the researchers must submit multiple, cumbersome applications and a lengthy review process which can delay their ability to publish. OI conducted a series of workshops to craft a single application form that works for both researchers and state reviewers for all CHHS departments. The more complete information gathered in the form helps speed review processes.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2018/11/02/LAS.html">LAS</a></h2>
      <p><p>Tl:dr - The CHHS Agency and departments analyze proposed bills to report on any impact the bills have on government services. Agency wanted a single system to review and approve the analysis workflows. The current solution is a home grown solutions provided by DSS technology department following sound agile processes. OI worked with Agency to establish a product management process so that the most important features for users get prioritized.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2018/10/05/DMHC-Recruiting.html">DMHC Recruiting</a></h2>
      <p><p>Tl:dr - DMHC’s technology department lost interesting candidates because they took other jobs while waiting for the state’s longer hiring process. The OI team worked with representatives from HR and IT to craft a better job listing template, provide better direction on completing the state application process, and illustrate the great working culture at DMHC. The new template yielded applicants that previously had not considered working for the state.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2018/10/05/DMHC-Distance.html">DMHC Distance</a></h2>
      <p><p>Tl:dr - We worked with the Dept of Managed Health Care to improve the cumbersome, inexact and time intensive process of collecting data on the relative burden to accessing health care (the distance between a medical provider and given client). Working shoulder to shoulder with subject matter experts OI prototypes removed redundant steps, better utilized existing tools and created a process to improve process time by 70%. The reduction in staff frustration creating a more effective work environment that continues to pay dividends.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2018/10/05/CAMMIS.html">CAMMIS</a></h2>
      <p><p>Tl:dr - The CA-MMIS team is working to replace a legacy system that can no longer keep up with the growing needs of Medicaid payments. The organization was trying to modernize the system while moving the legacy system to a new support vendor. The OI team helped test the proposed modernization vision to discover the parts that best resonated with staff. They also helped craft the concept of a high-level sponsorship team made up out of internal and external stakeholders to work through the approval processes collaboratively to improve speed and efficiency.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2018/09/21/CDPH-Burden-of-Disease.html">CDPH Burden of Disease</a></h2>
      <p><p>Tl:dr - CDPH was working on a tight deadline to provide a visualization of the burden of disease data across several criteria such as location, disease type, etc. The OI team worked with the team to produce a bug tracking process to identify, prioritize and address the issues. The team also provided high level product management methodology training.</p>
