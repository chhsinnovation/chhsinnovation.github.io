<p>OI does not hire outside staff. Instead, we take talented state staff and teach them modern digital service delivery skills. Working in teams of four, OI staff engage with departments to define problems, transform ideas into prototypes and test them to ensure the best ideas move forward.</p>

<p>Our success depends on support from leadership at the CHHS Agency and across the Departments to break down silos, create a safe space for experimentation and provide air cover while the teams define and untangle these complex challenges.</p>

          Our structure is that existing state staff join the office either as full time or part time members for 2 years stints. Then, they return to their home departments to spread the skills and mindsets they learned with OI.

          <ul>
            <li>Each cohort last 2 years.</li>
            <li>A new cohort starts every year in June, so the cohorts overlap by one year.</li>
            <li>The maximum staff size is 24 comprised of 16 full time and 8 part time regardless of cohort.</li>
            <li>Therefore, the size of each incoming cohort varies based on the amount of available openings.</li>

              <p>Since the OI launched in 2018, the OI staff have worked on successful engagements with 13 CHHS departments. Our efforts have helped departments improve worksflows by 60%, cut processing times by more than half, helped deliver prioritized product value, improved software delivery times and improved service delivery for key populations.</p>

              <p>Our other key deliverable is skills exchange with your department. The OI teams work shoulder to shoulder with your staff teaching our methods as we build solutions. These methods continue to help your organization after the engagement to continue tightly defining problems so they spend less time fixing the wrong problems and more time fixing the right ones. Staff returning to your department after training and experience working on projects will:</p>

              <p>Have a better holistic view of CHHS and State government services, specifically:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>The dependencies and interrelations of departments and services:</li>
                  <ol>
                    <li>How your department fits into the larger scope of the services provided by the state</li>
                    <li>The value of multiple departments working collaboratively to realize larger goals</li>
                  </ol>
                <li>Have connections in many other CHHS Departments/Agency staff A better understanding of the roles and specific services provided by each department to know where there might be value in collaboration for your department</li>
                <li>Be well versed on Governance processes and work happening at the CHHS agency level.</li>
                <li>Have experience with a wide variety of processes/technologies that may benefit your organization Bring knowledge of process improvements that have been successful in other areas that may be scalable for your department.</li>
                <li>Bring a new eye towards creating efficiencies and making your department processes more lean.</li>
