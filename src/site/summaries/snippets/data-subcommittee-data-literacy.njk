{% set outcomes %}
Feedback from prototype testing indicate that the existing playbook content is valuable, just not as itâ€™s currently organized. Some of the resources are hidden, some are too prominent, and additional resources are needed to make it responsive to the data-related needs of staff.

We demoed our findings to the Data Subcommittee team and the Ad Council. Both entities have found our findings and recommendations valuable and are currently looking to restructure and are putting together an action plan based on these findings.
