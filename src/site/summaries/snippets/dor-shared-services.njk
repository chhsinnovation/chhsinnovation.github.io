{% endset %}

{% set outcomes %}
Through the work of the Office of Innovation team, DOR was able to see the value in identifying existing models and best practices that they can share and scale within the organization. Utilizing and scaling models that leverage collaboration and coordination of care, DOR is able to more effectively make those connections between consumers and the local services that will benefit them. 

This coordination also focuses their efforts on the services they provide best, which allows them to make the most efficient use of their resources. 

As a result there are new local connections to community resources that have been established and are flourishing in at least one of the local field offices.
