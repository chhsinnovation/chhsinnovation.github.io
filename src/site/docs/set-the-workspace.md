## Set up the workspace

As always, before we begin, let's set up your workspace.

1. Open up Visual Studio Code.

2. If needed, go to the `File` menu, and select `Open Folder`. Navigate to the `chhsinnovation.github.io` folder on your computer. Select it. 

3. If needed, open up your command-line terminal by going to the `Termimnal` menu and selecting `Open Terminal`.

4. Run the site by entering the `npm run start` command. 

5. Click on the `Local` web address that appears in your terminal, either [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) or [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).
