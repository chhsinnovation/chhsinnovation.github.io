title: Executive Summary
---
Working in teams of 4-5, we completed 21 engagements each lasting between two to eight weeks.

We create a culture of precise problem definition, deep dive discovery and rapid prototyping to deliver process improvement, better communications, product management skills and effective use of data-driven decision making.

In year 1, we worked with 15 CHHS departments including agency and external state partners. Our approach is flexible, fast and effective.

In Year 2, we will evolve our ability to develop fully coded applications to support the new workflows we develop. We will advance the use of data throughout the organization. We will also apply lessons learned from engagements across multiple departments.

Please check out the work we did across a wide variety of disciplines and topic areas.
