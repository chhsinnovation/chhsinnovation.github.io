Overview

The California Health and Human Services Agency (CHHS) Office of Innovation (OI) follows a data driven, Human Centered Design (HCD) approach to tightly define problems, imagine novel solutions and prototype & test the solutions. HCD is a process that starts with the people we are designing for and ends with innovative solutions that are tailor-made to suit their needs.

The initial phase of the HCD process, referred to as the “Discovery” phase, involves researching user needs to elicit useful information, which is then synthesized with other information sources to make informed design decisions. During this phase, OI teams conduct user interviews in order to empathize with and understand the people who have direct experience, secondary experience or peripheral experience with a process, problem or issue. The goal is to generate insights to innovate and improve by:

Observing end-users and stakeholders
Understanding their experience  
Feeling what they feel to identify patterns of behavior, pain points, and opportunities.

The HCD approach requires the researcher to build rapport with and really engage users and stakeholders when gathering information and the user consultations is an excellent vehicle for doing so.

Stakeholder Mapping
Initial Discovery research involves identifying and classifying users and stakeholders as potential interviewees. Typically they are broken down by the following types:

Direct experience - people who have lived experience with the challenge you are trying to address
Indirect experience - those who have already been doing work to address the challenge
Subject experience - people with subject matter business, civic or design experience
Community connections - people or groups with strong local connections
Power and influence - people with political or capital power to unlock resources or constraints

Developing Consultation Materials
Part of planning and preparing for interviews includes developing interview questions. It’s good to know what you want to capture during an interview and this helps to act as a guide for determining questions you want to ask. While the questions may differ slightly depending on the user type, it’s a good practice to ask a similar set of about three to five questions universal to all groups. Examples of these can be
“What is your role in the organization and how does it fit with the problem space?”
“How long have you been working with this process?”,
“Please describe what is working well with this process?”
“Please describe what is not working well with this process”
 “If you could change one thing about this process what would it be?”
“What didn’t we ask that you want to add, that may relate to the problem space?”

Plan to ask open ended “What and who” type questions and also “why” type questions, which elicit the most useful and powerful answers, especially when the interviewer can listen with empathy. The idea is to get the interviewee to tell you a story with their answers. User stories are the key to shaping a solution or product with the end user at the forefront.
Conducting Interviews
Start all interviews by introducing your team, problem space & HCD process (unless interviewee is already familiar with them), and assurance that interview is confidential and OI will only share synthesis document with the management with no name attached.

Always conduct interviews in pairs. It’s important that one interviewer can remain engaged and maintain eye contact with the interviewee while the other can take detailed notes and also observe the interviewee’s body language and facial expressions. It’s also important to develop a rapport with the interviewee early on in order to establish trust and have a safe space for them to be open in their answers and elaborate and tell their story. A good way to establish a rapport is by starting the interview with non-design related questions or small talk. Also, if applicable, reassure the interviewee that their answers will remain confidential, that answers from all interviewees will be aggregated and no names will be attached the info being provided

Empathetic Listening
Listen to truly understand the person, resist the urge to formulate your response, avoid applying the lens of your own story.
Listen for feelings, perspectives and motivations, pay attention to both verbal and nonverbal cues, confirm your understanding by restating what was said, in your own words.

The benefits of empathetic listening are that it allows you to understand another’s needs and wants, to “diagnose before you prescribe” and uncover the assumptions or biases that often lead us astray because we take them as truths.

Do a Deep Dive - The Five Why’s*
Don’t settle for the first answer you get. Always try to dig deeper to understand the interviewee’s point of view.

Ask a broad question to start
Then ask “why” to their response, five times in a row
Go for depth; don’t change the subject
Write down what you hear and observations of facial expression and body language, especially the insights you gather as you go deeper.

Avoid Misinterpretations
Misinterpreting an interviewee’s responses can lead to erroneous information being collected. It is critical to document interviewee’s wording or to ensure the interviewer and those later reviewing the notes understands all responses. It’s important to ask clarifying questions as needed to ensure the interviewee’s responses are fully understood.

Be Flexible & Opportunistic
The interviewer will naturally be unaware of many areas that might be of interest prior to the interview. A flexible approach to the interview process allows the interviewer to recognize these relevant areas and follow-up with them in the moment. The interviewer can probe into a topic area brought up by the interviewee (unrelated to the original questions). The interviewer can then adjust their questions/approach after learning more about the user or stakeholder.

Other interviewing tips include:
Ask questions neutrally
Don’t be hesitant to ask the “whys”
Encourage storytelling
Look for inconsistencies
Never say “usually” when asking a question
Pay attention to nonverbal cues
Don’t be afraid of silence. Sometimes the interviewee needs to absorb the question and formulate their thoughts before giving a thorough answer.
Interview Documentation
When taking notes during an interview, try to capture all relevant information provided by the interviewee, including quotable statements, and not worry about organization at that time. What is most important is capturing as much information as possible. After the interview is over, when the information is still fresh in your mind, it’s a good idea to do a quick edit of the notes and fill in any gaps you didn’t have time to thoroughly document during the interview.
Conclusion
Following the interview process, responses from users and stakeholders are reviewed by the team and synthesized by pulling commonalities and themes, which will guide the next steps in the design process.
