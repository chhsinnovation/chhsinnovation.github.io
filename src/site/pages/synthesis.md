Overview
The California Health and Human Services Agency (CHHS) Office of Innovation (OI) follows a data-driven, Human Centered Design (HCD) approach to tightly define problems, imagine novel solutions and prototype & test the solutions. HCD is a process that starts with the people we are designing for and ends with innovative solutions that are tailor-made to suit their needs.

The initial phase of the HCD process, referred to as the “Discovery” phase, involves researching user  needs by conducting consultation interviews with users and stakeholders. Synthesis of the interview responses is necessary in order to develop a holistic view of the information gathered and identify problem areas and formulate effective recommendations to elicit useful information.
Review of Interview Notes
Once all interviews have been conducted and note taker documentation finalized, the first step toward synthesis of the information gathered is a quick review of the notes. It’s best to review them chronologically from the earliest interview to the most recent as a refresher and to follow the flow of the interviews. While performing this preliminary review, it’s important to:
Make mental notes of patterns of topics and recurring pain points to help guide the compiling process.
Start generating ideas for categories the information can be compiled into  
Start identifying common themes that emerge throughout your interviews
On each set of notes, document some key insights and learnings and also highlight any quotes that really stand out
Categorization
Based on your analysis of interview responses as a whole, break down the information into categories based on the common threads reported across all the interviews. An example of categories can be major milestones that occur in a process that is touched by interviewees from different sections in an organization. Sub-processes within those categories can be fleshed out later; the goal here is to develop a list of categories and then go back through the interview notes and tag content related to each category. The end product is a set of qualitative information to use for conducting a deeper analysis, including identifying pain points based on interview responses.
Pain Points
A pain point is an area of concern that causes frustration for the user or stakeholder of a process. If your initial analysis of the interview responses shows a pattern of common pain points, make note of who brought them up. Knowing which interviewee identified which pain point helps with developing the narrative and might show the differing perspectives of the process categories amongst different units or sections within the organization. It’s important to differentiate what may be an annoying or tedious, but necessary part of a process from what may be a personal preference of the interviewee. Then align the pain points with the categories that emerged during synthesis of common threads.
Conclusion
Once you’ve synthesized findings from user/stakeholder interviews into categories and have identified the pain points within those categories, you’re ready to create a journey map of the current-state process and begin exploring solutions with your users and stakeholders for a “new and improved” future-state process.
