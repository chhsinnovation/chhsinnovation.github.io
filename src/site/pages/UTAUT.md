Guidelines for Success Metrics                                                              
For every engagement, it is imperative that success metrics are captured. Every engagement is different, so there will be different types of success metrics that will be utilized.

There are many different methods/tools to capture the success metrics. Selection of the method can vary depending on the end goal. It is very important to capture the baseline metrics in the beginning of an engagement or project. Knowing what data to capture and how these data are going to be measured toward success, will help in choosing the right tool. This document includes one of the tools that the Office of Innovations uses called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) survey.

The UTAUT survey is an excellent tool for predicting if someone will use a technology or not. We use UTAUT to help determine how likely people are to find our prototypes more useful than their current processes.

The following examples are things to consider when developing your success metrics:
Revise the UTAUT survey to fit your project’s needs. You may not need all of the questions included in the survey and some of the terminology may need to be changed (e.g., instead of the question asking about a change to the system, you may edit the text to ask about a change in the process).

Use the UTAUT in a pretest manner to measure the as-is (or current) process, program, system, etc.
Use the UTAUT in a posttest manner after you’ve created and tested a prototype with users to measure the “new” process, program, system, etc.

Produce side-by-side charts to compare the pretest and posttest results.
See Data Visualization Standards on page 5 for chart examples, colors, fonts, and best practices when creating visualizations.

If your project involves a process improvement, you can measure the amount of time the as-is process is taking and then measure the amount of time it takes after you’ve provided whatever solution you’ve developed (i.e., prototype).
