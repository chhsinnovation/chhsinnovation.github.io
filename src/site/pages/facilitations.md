What is Facilitation?
Facilitation is the art of supporting a group at a workshop or event to effectively solve problems, make decisions, learn together, and achieve its objectives. In order to succeed, a facilitator needs to apply a combination of skills, knowledge, structure, and process to the interactions of the group.  The most essential skills and knowledge for facilitators are briefly summarized in this overview. The structure and process come from various tools and methods, such as the tools included in this Toolbox. 
Facilitation is not itself a tool, rather it is the enabler that makes it possible to succeed in using knowledge exchange tools for sharing, discovery, and co-creation. It is crucial when large numbers of individuals come together for a short time and expect to work effectively. Good facilitation improves group dynamics, stimulates creativity, empowers collaborative problem-solving, and in general enables groups and individuals to perform at their best. Facilitation skills improve with practice and through learning from other practitioners.
Facilitators are also often involved in advance planning of sessions (refer to Annex 1: Planning a knowledge exchange session), and should be familiar with materials used at sessions (refer to Annex 2: Materials for face-to-face knowledge exchange sessions).
Facilitation is a large topic, and only its most essential aspects are summarized here. The list of references is a good starting point for those who want to learn more.

The Role of a Facilitator
The role of a facilitator at a face-to-face meeting or event includes creating conditions for people to feel relaxed, comfortable and empowered so that they can work well together; maintaining objectivity so that s/he can be an effective process guide; and sustaining momentum towards the agreed objectives. A facilitator should create an atmosphere of trust, encourage active participation, and explore useful differences of opinion while seeking to identify common ground and build consensus. Useful personal characteristics for a facilitator include being:
A good listener, listening actively, asking reflective questions, paraphrasing responses to check for understanding, paying attention to participants’ body language, and the words used.
Engaging, relaxed with groups of people, able to sustain conversations with people from different backgrounds and roles, and using humour appropriately.
Empathetic, able to understand how others are feeling, and being aware of group energy levels, body language and any feelings of disparity in discussions and contributions.
Assertive with regard to the process (but neutral with regard to the issues), able to confidently guide group activity in constructive ways, defuse conflicts and create equitable opportunities to contribute.
Flexible, able to think on their feet and adapt to situations as they evolve.
Able to manage difficulties that occur during sessions (loudness, disruptions, cynicism, attempts to dominate the session, self-proclaimed experts, etc.).

Fundamental Facilitation Skills
Your success as a facilitator will be underpinned by a number of specific skills, which you should use at any sessions you facilitate:
Preparation, preparation, preparation! Do your homework beforehand. Speak to the meeting organisers to clarify the objectives and intended outcomes and to understand any major sensitivities or difficult issues which may arise. (See also Annex 1 below, ‘Planning a knowledge exchange session’, for specific tips on planning.) Consider both the ‘hard outcomes’ (documents, other outputs, or tasks to be completed by the end of the session) and ‘soft outcomes’ (engagement, motivation, consensus, etc.) that you want. Prepare the room as much as possible beforehand including ensuring you have a basic ‘facilitator’s toolkit’ of different coloured Post-its or cards, pens, stickers, masking tape, flipcharts, etc. to avoid needing to disrupt the flow looking for these on the day of the event, and setting the room up according to the requirements of the tool you will be using. (See also Annex 2 below, ‘Session materials’, for a detailed list.)
Know your participants and their context (if possible.) Knowing a few things about the participants in a knowledge exchange session will enable you to facilitate more effectively:
Number of participants, roles and affiliations, demographic information (language, gender, age), any relationships among them, etc.
Are the participants working in a hierarchical organizational culture? If so you will need to emphasize the value of diversity and actively encourage contributions from everyone, even more than you usually might, and incorporate corresponding provisions in your ground rules for the session.
Do you know anything about the social and interaction styles of particular members of the group that might need to be taken into account?
Are any participants vested in particular solutions, or do any of them feel compelled to support particular viewpoints? If so, take care to promote a balanced approach to the issues.
Create a congenial environment. Make people feel genuinely welcome. Build rapport by making clear how the session relates to them, and by sharing any prior experience or knowledge you may have in the areas of discussion. Empathize with their needs and concerns.
Set house rules. Identify these and have them agreed by participants at the start of the session. For example, house rules might include: respect all opinions, be tough on the problem and not on the people, no use of phones or laptops except by rapporteurs for their duties, time limits for participants when they talk, and/or other rules.
Ensure there is group clarity on the objectives and outputs. In some cases these will be assigned and cannot be changed. In other cases, if objectives and outputs are unclear, the group can discuss, adjust and agree on them.
Be ready to customize your approach. Knowing that one size does not fit all, a good facilitator: is prepared to customize tools and processes to fit a group’s needs; is flexible in the implementation of tools as each situation warrants; does not force a ready-made solution on participants and instead works with the group to discover a unique.
Engage participants and elicit responses. This is best done through enquiry, that is, by asking questions that are thought-provoking and that resonate with the participants. The most useful questions for promoting useful discussions are open-ended, i.e. questions that cannot be answered with either Yes/No or with short specific answers. For example:
What do you think of ...
How do you feel about ...
How important is ...
To what extent do you ...
How could we improve on ...
These types of questions can lead to wide- ranging conversations about the topics at hand. Once you have a few answers to these questions, you can begin asking others to comment on the responses offered so far. If their views differ, you can ask why. In this way you can sustain the dialogue, promote reflection and gradually build towards a shared understanding and agreement.
Encourage contributions from everyone. Key means of encouraging contributions include: having “unconditional positive regard” for all participants, recognizing that each individual is a unique human being with contributions to make; acknowledging the strengths of quiet people to build their confidence to contribute; and channelling the energy of extroverts towards the outputs and objectives, while maintaining equal opportunities for all to contribute.
Provoke useful controversy. Get people to look at both sides of an issue before reaching a conclusion. You can do this by asking probing questions, prompting for dissenting opinions, and using tools like Topsy Turvy to explore negative aspects of an issue without censorship. Be sure to include a house rule stating that the group will tackle the problem and not the people.
Be non-directive with regard to the issues. In most situations, it is best for facilitators to refrain from giving substantive inputs on the issues (while remaining guardians of an effective process). Playing a dual role as facilitator and content expert can make it difficult for the facilitator to be perceived as objective by participants. If acting as both facilitator and content expert is unavoidable, then establish clear boundaries and inform participants when acting as an expert, and when you have stepped away from that role to act as facilitator. This requires great restraint.
Monitor the process. Ensure the meeting stays on track while responding as needed to emerging ideas and to the energy levels of the group. In addition to using your listening skills, if you need a more formal check on the process, you can use real-time evaluation tools (see the article of the same name in this Toolbox.)
Energize the group when needed. If you notice a dip in participants’ energy levels, you can use an energizer technique to invigorate them. (See the reference list in the ‘Icebreakers’ article in this Toolbox for links to energizer techniques.) If specific participants seem to have lost interest, you can re-engage then with requests for their feedback or follow-up questions. If the group as a whole seems disengaged, then bring them back to the purpose of the session, objectives, outputs and benefits to be achieved.

Build Consensus. Consensus does not mean that there are no disagreements among group members. Instead it means that group members have agreed on a means to achieve the shared objectives of the session. This usually happens by participants first speaking their views openly, then listening to others’ views, comparing alternatives, and finally coalescing around a few important decisions. As participants express their views, you should listen for areas of agreement, and rephrase their inputs in order to make implicit agreement more clear. When appropriate, verify that the agreement is genuine and not forced due to time constraints, pressure from others or fear of judgement. Confirm that any consensus reached is in line with the session objectives.
Avoid arguments. If a significant disagreement arises, don’t be drawn into an emotionally-charged debate on who’s right or wrong. Instead, lead the participants away from confrontation by helping identify areas of agreement, or by using open questions that build towards a solution, or that get at the wider implications of the problem. For example: Are there any drawbacks to the proposed solution? How would this approach be implemented in practice? What would need to happen for this to work? Etc.
Maintain the focus in order to achieve session objectives and goals. This includes keeping time limits in mind, allocating enough time to the various parts of the discussions, and moving on to the next step when it is time to do so. It also includes connecting participants’ inputs to the session outputs and objectives. This can be a challenging task, but it is one of the most important. If the inputs don’t seem to be leading towards the outputs or objectives, you may need to get confirmation from participants – verbally, through tone of voice or even body language – as to how essential they really are. If issues are raised that don’t contribute to the intended outcomes, ‘park’ them by noting them down for separate discussion, and keep driving the discussion forward. Don’t criticize the non- essential inputs, but do keep the focus of the discussions on the really important ones.
Use silence well. Silence has a powerful presence. Don’t be concerned by silent pauses; instead, welcome them as space for reflection or as a way of ensuring that the group focuses on what you have asked or said. The silence may seem uncomfortable at first but filling it with inconsequential chatter will not help. However don’t prolong silences beyond a reasonable limit of perhaps 45 to 60 seconds. Occasionally you might deliberately create a space for silent reflection of a couple of minutes or so to allow participants to think about a question before responding. This gives introverted participants time to reflect and prepare to contribute.
Know when to push and when not to. This is one of the more advanced facilitation skills. In some cases, a group can be pushed to do more work or to dig deeper in exploring challenging issues, but no group can be pushed to achieve a solution that it cannot, or does not want to reach independently. Sometimes an issue needs to be set to the side to be dealt with at a later stage if the current discussion is not yielding agreement or new ideas. Good facilitators are able to gauge the willingness of participants to be led, and know when to forge ahead to help them meet the meeting objectives, and when they must let the group itself determine what it can do and how.

Essential Knowledge for Facilitators
Repertoire of tools and methods
Facilitators should ideally be familiar with a number of tools and methods, covering the following broad objectives:
Helping participants get to know one other (icebreakers).
Showcasing information or knowledge products.
Presenting new findings and gathering feedback.
Discussing issues, solving problems and planning.
Generating creative ideas.
Identifying lessons from experience.
Planning sessions and events (see ‘Annex 1: Planning a knowledge exchange session’ below).
 Materials commonly used at sessions (see ‘Annex 2: Materials for face-to-face knowledge exchange sessions’ below).
Monitoring sessions.

Facilitators should be able to choose a tool that is appropriate for the goals of the meeting sponsor, the size of the group, time constraints, and participants’ expertise levels. Facilitators also need the ability to monitor participant reactions, adapt tools based on how well they are working, and even to swap them out for others if they do not work.

Understanding required levels of facilitator involvement
Some tools allow the facilitator to introduce the process and then step back, letting participants’ voices predominate (sometimes with support from participant volunteers
acting as temporary facilitators or table hosts), and intervening only occasionally with a bit of guidance. Such tools include the World Café, the Fish Bowl, and the Expert Interview, among others. If volunteer moderators are needed, choose them carefully and brief them fully on their roles; they will likely be responsible for collating the outputs from a session.

Other tools, such as Brainstorming, Topsy Turvy or Chat Show, require sustained facilitator involvement, using all of the skills described above, in order to achieve the best results.

Knowledge of organizational behaviour and group dynamics
When individuals gather in a group to produce specific outputs and achieve agreed objectives, one of the most important success factors is trust and respect among participants. All individuals have their own distinct needs and expectations, and it can be hard to reconcile individual perspectives without first laying a basis for collaboration.

This is the rationale for icebreakers. By overcoming the initial barriers of unfamiliarity or reluctance to engage with others, they open lines of communication and create a kind of loose initial bond of camaraderie. This in turn makes it more likely for the individuals to coalesce into a successful group – a kind of temporary team that seeks to produce the outputs and achieve the objectives of the session, and leverages its diversity for better results.

Mutual understanding and effective collaboration can be further cultivated through small group activities, such as Buzz Groups or the individual tables of a World Café, among others. The actions of the facilitator, employing all the skills described above, will also contribute greatly to the forming, normalizing and subsequent successful performance of the group.

All these processes are most important in groups whose members don’t know each other. Groups of persons who know each other very well may come up to speed much quicker, but such groups have their own challenges. Typically, they require extra support to think innovatively and break out of well-worn patterns of interaction. An infusion of new participants, not previously known to most group members, is very helpful in such cases.

Improving Your Facilitation Skills

Don’t be daunted by the range of skills required to be a good facilitator. The best way to improve is to get started, preferably with one of the simpler tools like Fishbowl, and use your facilitation skills regularly. Combine practice with reading and reflection. Move on to more challenging tools such as Chat Show or Timeline when you feel confident. If possible, join a facilitation community of practice and learn from other practitioners. The importance of facilitation is increasing in the modern work environment, including in international development, and skilled facilitators have much to offer the teams and organizations they work with.


Annex 1: Planning a knowledge exchange session

A knowledge exchange session is an event in which a group of participants and a facilitator apply a knowledge exchange tool, or sometimes a combination of tools, in order to achieve specific objectives. Here are a few examples of sessions and their objectives:
A brainstorming session can result in new ideas for problem-solving, products or services.
A SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity & Threat) session can help a group to tackle a difficult decision, or to lay the foundation for a strategic plan for a new project or initiative.
A session using the Retrospect tool can yield valuable lessons impacting how future projects/ initiatives are implemented.

Knowledge exchange sessions using the tools in this Toolbox may take place as stand-alone events, or as part of workshops incorporating several sessions. The brief summary presented here focuses on planning for a single session.

Good planning will make facilitation easier and will improve the achievement of group objectives. In some cases, a facilitator may be called in to run a session at short notice, and thus s/he will not have the opportunity to participate in the planning process. But whenever possible facilitators should also be involved in planning.

Steps to planning a knowledge exchange session
Initial preparation:
Background/context: Understand the rationale behind organizing the session.
Purpose: Determine the objectives and expected outcomes. These may be given to you, or you may be able to influence or even decide them. Establishing clear objectives and communicating them to participants greatly increases the likelihood of a productive meeting.  
Participants: Confirm who should participate. Participants should be those who can achieve the objectives and expected outcomes of the session. Key questions include:
What is expected of them? What are their expectations?
Do they have the right professional backgrounds?
Does the group include sufficiently diverse perspectives to tackle the problem being addressed?
How many participants will there be in total?
Are there any existing relationships and/or conflicts between the participants which could influence the achievement of outcomes?

Session organization:
Tool and facilitation: Identify a facilitator, and together choose a knowledge exchange tool that is appropriate for the context, expected outcomes, facilitator’s degree of experience, objectives and participants. Some tools require more than one facilitator, but sometimes these can be drawn from volunteers on the spot. Refer to the detailed guidance for the chosen tool and plan appropriately.
Venue: Plan for a venue appropriate to the number of participants and the type of tool selected.
Budget: Funds are not always required, depending on the participants, venue and other factors. But if funds are needed, for example to cover room costs, travel costs, refreshments, or other incidentals, then ensure that budget is available.
Specific preparations for the chosen tool: Each tool in this Toolbox includes a description of the steps it requires for advance preparation (as well as for implementation and for follow-up, if any).

Resources:
Rapporteurs: Assign a person/persons to this role in advance, to capture key points from the discussions as well as outputs. See also ‘Reporting’ below.
Materials: Many of the tools highlighted in the Knowledge Exchange Toolkit require materials like flipchart stands, flipcharts, pin boards and colour cards. These are suggestions and may be improvised as needed. See list of materials in Annex 2.
IT Support: This is needed not only for tools making extensive use of technology (such as webinars, streamed or televised sessions) but may also be necessary for presentations.

Reporting: Documenting facilitated processes can be challenging for people who are unused to the informal nature of the tools used. It requires careful planning and coordination before the session. There are several ways to capture outputs from facilitated sessions, depending on the tools used:
Rapporteur notes: Rapporteurs may be used to capture key highlights from plenary discussions and Q&A sessions. In some cases these may be captured using colour coded cards (pre-determined) and pinned on boards, or clustered either by a knowledgeable rapporteur or with the help of the group. Another option is simply to have the rapporteur take detailed notes. If the session exceeds 1 hour, more than one rapporteur is needed as note-taking is an intensive activity. Notes may need to be edited later if they are to be shared.
Session outputs: Depending on the tool, sessions may produce outputs based on group discussions. These outputs may be structured using pre-planned templates, either on a computer or drawn onto flipcharts. Flipchart outputs can then be photographed and stored for later use.
Social reporting: Sometimes participants may write up their own accounts of participating in the session and post them on internal social media (such as an organizational social network, an internal blog, etc.). You can encourage this if appropriate, as a supplementary means of reporting. See also ‘Real-time monitoring tools’ elsewhere in this toolbox.

Annex 2: Materials for face-to-face knowledge exchange sessions

Different tools have different material requirements. Review and select from the following, according to the specific requirements of the tool to be used:
A room large enough for all participants, preferably with natural light.
Tables and chairs (preferably not fixed to floor, to facilitate group work).
For presentations: Laptop with internet connection, projector and screen.
Flipcharts (preferably the “sticky” kind if available), and plenty of spare flipchart paper.
Flipchart stands.
Marker pens (with wide bevel tip), in assorted colours such as black, blue, red, and green.
Recording materials for rapporteurs according to their preferences and the required outputs of the session, e.g. own laptops, pens and paper.
Name tags (for groups where people do not know each other).
Pens and notepads for participants.
Refreshments, at minimum coffee and water. Whenever possible, include healthy options.
Wi-Fi for participants.
Break out rooms (as needed) each with flipcharts and other materials.
If needed: A centre/top table and stage for making presentations.
Papers (8 ½  x 11 and/or 11 x 17 inches), and large post-it notes for participants to write out ideas, and for problem solving activities, in at least 4 pastel colours (blue, pink, yellow, green).
Pins and pin boards for posting cards.
Masking tape (1” and 2” inch wide) or other adhesive materials.
Gong or similarly loud tool which can cut through the sound of large group chatter and enable you to encourage people to reconvene.
Digital camera/phone camera to capture work on pin boards and flipcharts. For large meetings or conferences, a camera can be used to take photos of participants at registration (or an e-photo can be sent beforehand). The photos can then be placed on a wall with names underneath to facilitate networking.
