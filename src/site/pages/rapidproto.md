What is Rapid Protyping?
For human-centered designers, Rapid Prototyping is an incredibly effective way to make ideas tangible, to learn through making a prototype, and to quickly get key feedback from the people we are designing for. Because prototypes are meant only to convey an idea - not to be perfect - we can quickly move through a variety of iterations, building on what we learned from the people we are designing for. Rapid Prototyping makes sure that we are building only enough to test our idea, and that we are right back in there making it better once we have gotten the feedback we need.
Steps
Once Determined What to Prototype is determined, the time has come to build it.
We can make any number of types of prototypes: Storyboards, Role Plays, models, mock-ups. The goal here is to make something tangible that conveys the idea we want to test. No need to make it perfect, just make it good enough to get the idea across.
Now we take the prototype out and test it with people we are designing for. Put it in their hands and ask them what they make of it. Make sure to Get Feedback.
Here is where we can now Integrate Feedback and Iterate. Once we quickly built another prototype we’ll do it all over again until it’s just right.
Determine What to Prototype
(There are so many ways to prototype an idea, here’s how to isolate what to test.)
Our idea will have lots of testable components, so be clear about what we need to learn and which components will give us the necessary answers. Prototyping isn’t about being precious. Make simple, scrappy prototypes to not only save time, but to focus testing on just the critical elements.  At this stage we should have a lot of questions about how our idea should work. This is a great way to begin answering them.
Steps
Think practically about what needs to be tested and write down primary questions for each component.
Now pick a few questions to answer. For an interaction, consider putting on a skit with the team. If it’s a logo, we can print it out and stick it on a t-shirt to solicit feedback.
Think through what kind of prototype makes the most sense to answer these questions. We might consider holding a Brainstorm session with the team now.
Remember, this process is about learning, not getting it right the first time. Better to test a miserable failure and learn from it, rather than take ages making a beautiful, highly refined prototype.
Guidelines for Starting a Prototype Development Process
Just start drawing the ideas: Quantity over Quality.
Don’t spend too much time on each: No emotional attachment!
Prototypes should be testable.
Build with user in mind.
Getting Feedback
(We test prototype with the people we are designing for and see what they think.)
Soliciting feedback keeps the people we are designing for at the center of our project. It’s also a direct path to designing something that those same people will adopt. If the point of a prototype is to test an idea, then collecting feedback from potential users is what pushes things forward.
Steps
Now that we have got a prototype to share, get it in front of the people we are designing for to solicit feedback.
Capturing honest feedback is crucial. People may praise our prototype to be nice, so we have to assure them that this is only a tool by which to learn and that we welcome honest, even negative feedback.
Share with lots of people so that we get a variety of reactions, making sure that both “Extremes” and “Mainstreams” potential users are captured.
We use the feedback to improve the prototype and ask more questions and push our ideas further.
Integrate Feedback and Iterate
(Let the feedback of the people we are designing for guide the next iteration of our solution.)
Integrating the feedback we hear from the people we are designing for is one of the essential elements of HCD. One of the best ways to keep learning from user’s is to show them what we have made and find out what they think. Integrating their feedback into our work and then coming up with another prototype is the best way to refine our idea until it’s something that’s bound to be adopted and embraced.
Steps
Sit with our design team & share the feedback that we collected and what we learned.
We will now probably want to synthesize some of the feedback we got. We can Create Frameworks based on what we heard and how it applies to our idea. We might also now try a Brainstorm around how our idea could change based on the feedback.
Get tangible now and start building the next iteration of our prototype. Integrating Feedback and Iterating is closely tied to Rapid Prototyping. So once we have determined how our prototype should change to reflect the feedback we got, we build it.
We usually do it a few times to work out the kinks and get to the right answer.
