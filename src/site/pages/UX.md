Best Practices for UX Testing
User experience (UX) testing is a technique helping to evaluate a product by testing it on potential users.

Schedule an appropriate amount of time to conduct the testing session.
Set up your testing location in a quiet place to minimize distractions.
Conduct the testing session as a team of at least two.
One team member reads the script (use the one on pages 2-3 or create a new one)
One team member is a silent observer taking notes
Notes should include as much detail as possible about the user’s verbal comments and you can also add information pertaining to  body language and facial expressions if they help to convey the user’s experience.
Notes should also include how easily and quickly users accomplish the tasks you’ve given them.
The script below is based on a specific website. If using this script, make any necessary changes to the text so that it relates to whatever product you’re testing.
After the testing session is complete, you can ask the user to complete the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) survey based on the prototype or product they just tested.


UX Testing Script for In-Person Observed Testing Sessions

Hello, ___________.  My name is ___________, and I’m going to be walking you through this session today.

Before we begin, I want to read this to you to make sure that I cover everything.  You probably already have a good idea of why we asked you here, but let me go over it again briefly.

We’re asking people to try using their own department’s Internet sites that are public facing for this testing.  The purpose of this session is to capture the user’s experience as the user is visiting the site for some intended need or purpose.  This will help us determine how usable and accessible sites are for its intended audience and where are the opportunities that can help improve the experience of users while they are visiting the sites.  The session should take about an hour.

The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing the website, its usability and accessibility.  We are not testing you.  You can’t do anything wrong here.  You can’t make mistakes.  In fact, if you encounter something weird it’ll help us learn what can be improved.  

As you use the website, I’m going to ask you as much as possible to try to think out loud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinking.  Just say what you’re thinking like a stream of consciousness.  This will be a big help to us.  

Also, we didn’t develop this website so please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings.  We’re doing this to find out the improvements that can enhance the user experience when they are visiting the site. We assure you that we will not attach names to any of the feedback, so your honest feedback will help us find the areas that can be enhanced for accessibility and usability of the site from a user’s perspective.

Secondly, if you have any questions as we go along, just ask them.  I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help.  Your questions will help us understand what other people might be thinking as well, so please ask them.  When we’re done I’ll try to answer them then.  And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know.
