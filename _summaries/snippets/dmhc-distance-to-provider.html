* A workflow / process map for how to transfer institutional knowledge among employees
* A central reference document of existing and potential tools for Geographic Information Systems / Processing / Analysis / Automation.
* Training tools to increase staff knowledge around ArcGIS, Statistics and SAS.
* Set up an initial knowledge base structure to store meeting minutes and notes from pre-filing conferences, and helpful articles and emails.

{% capture outcomes %}
Created a process flow and checklist that will reduce labor efforts by half. Started as an IT effort, but found better benefit in revising internal processes.

Procured a one-year license to ArcGIS; a feat that had been sought after for two years. Using a roadmap created by OI, ArcGIS will does the work currently done by three different tools, streamlining the process and standardizing the results.

“Implemented a formal policy of pre-work meetings for assigned filings, resulting in avoidance of issues with the same parts of review being done by more than one person, or being missed as both parties thought the other would be handling it. It also allows a formal time for asking questions, identifying external information that could be helpful. This effectively reduced work time up to about 30%. The reduction in ambiguity and staff frustration due to the pre-work meetings is less quantifiable, but not less important.”
