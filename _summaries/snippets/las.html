{% capture outcomes %}
Directly implemented the OI’s recommendations

“Conversations around categorizing what features our users want into delighters, performers, and must haves, now happen earlier in the process, which then helps us identify what can and should be accomplished in each release.”

“The benefit of working with the Innovation Team hasn’t been limited to concrete outcomes like prototypes. The longer-term benefit has been for the product owners and developers learning processes and tools, related to documenting user feedback, and road mapping based on priorities and workload, for example.”
