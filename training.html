We use proven digital service, product-driven, agile, lean design thinking and human-centered design and other innovative strategies to work with customers to build a thing that solves a problem. Before we can use these instruments, we must be trained in them and we must be able to practice what was learned in real engagements. So, the first step is to get trained.

Emphasis is placed on how to be a "trusted advisor," how to actively listen to and engage customer-stakeholders, how to generate high impact, actionable solutions, and how to use small bets and small wins to manage risk, build alignment and accelerate results.
