<p>We use proven digital service, product-driven, agile, lean design thinking and human-centered design and other innovative strategies to work with customers to build a thing that solves a problem. Before we can use these instruments, we must be trained in them and we must be able to practice what was learned in real engagements. So, the first step is to get trained. Please see below for a list of available courses.</p>

Through discussion and interactive, learn-by-doing activities, students learn how to be an internal consultant and how to use rapid innovation skills, tools, and mindsets to get to the root cause of challenges and develop solutions aligned with customer-stakeholder needs. Emphasis is placed on how to be a "trusted advisor," how to actively listen to and engage customer-stakeholders, how to generate high impact, actionable solutions, and how to use small bets and small wins to manage risk, build alignment and accelerate results. We also reflect on how to use the tools in team-based settings and end with individual commitment to use the tools in their everyday within five days so they can start building sustainable habits.
